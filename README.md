## Fizz Buzz in PyTorch 1.6 using AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)

[PyTorch - AUTOMATIC MIXED PRECISION](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/amp_recipe.html)

FizzBuzz, inspired from the **excellent blog post**
[Joel Grus - Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/)
PyTorch implementation borrowed heavily from
[fizz-buzz-pytorch](https://github.com/luckytoilet/fizz-buzz-pytorch)

This is meant to be a simple example of Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)
training in PyTorch 1.6.  I wrote it because many examples were too simple
or too complex.  Hopefully it can provide a little amuzement and show how
you may get faster training time taking advantage of AMP.

### Requirements:
- PyTorch 1.6
- Numpy
- Colorama
